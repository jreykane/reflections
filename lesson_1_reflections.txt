I don't have any thoughts on it right now.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can go back and look at previous versions.

I prefer to manually commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Too many questions.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

easily.

How might usig version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can revert to a previous version if I make a mistake.

Creating a new project
