What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

I'm not answering the question.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository?  What value do you think it offers?

Able to add some but not all files at one time.

huh?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

what?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Really nicely.
