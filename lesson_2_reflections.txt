What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

I'm not answering the question.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository?  What value do you think it offers?

Able to add some but not all files at one time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

huh?
